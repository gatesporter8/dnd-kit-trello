### dnd-kit trello board

This is a simple todo list app I built using https://dndkit.com/. It demonstrates the functionality of the useDroppable, and useSortable hooks. useSortable is an abstraction on top of the lower level useDraggable hook that smoothly animates the dragging and dropping sorting process, making the user experience more fluid and visually appealing.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
